A little experiment using git, Python and the Twitter API

# Premises

The following are a sequence of steps followed to prepare our system to be able to properly run-and-create the application. This may serve you in case you want to play with the code.

Usage of it relies on your own responsibility: it's not Rocket Science, but in case something goes wrong, you are fully responsible for the use of it (the intended usage of whatever I put in here is for my own personal use).

# Dependencies

To run this code, you may need to have installed in your computer or have available to the following set of components:

  1. **Python:** you need to have Python installed. I am working with Python 2.X, so I am not sure on whether the code may work with Python 3.X.
  2. **Python pip:** you need to have Python pip installed. This normally may be available on your Python Installation. Otherwise, please check [the Python Pip Page](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/).
  3. **Tweepy:** you need to have Tweepy Installed. Once [https://www.python.org](Python) and [Pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/) are installed, go into your terminal and shell and run `pip install tweepy`.
  4. **Twitter Account** You may need a [Twitter Account](https://www.twitter.com).
  5. **Twitter App Credentials** You DEFINITELY need a [Twitter App](https://apps.twitter.com) to gain the required credentials any developer needs to build an app, including:
    - Twitter Consumer Key
    - Twitter Consumer Secret Key
    - Twitter Access Token
    - Twitter Access Token Secret      |"
